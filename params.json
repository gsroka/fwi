If you want use it do it on your own.\r\nThe work is very old, I writed it time ago. I stopped the project,\r\nbecause I noticed the app works on some servers, and on some not. \r\nThis is caused by the server configuration which have defined \r\nthe amount of bytes when the output buffer data is sent to the browser.\r\nOf course the app still requires some work.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n--------------\r\nThis app is built under PHP and also uses bootstrap framework and jQuery. It requires at least PHP 5.2.\r\nThe main purpose of the app is downloading big and small files in realtime with small help of the AJAX.\r\nIt uses the server bandwidth(everything is done by server side).\r\n\r\nWhy you should use it?\r\n--------------\r\nAnswer is easy, is fast and user friendly!\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------------\r\nThe FWI is released under version 2.0 of the Apache License","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
