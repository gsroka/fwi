Tests Stage
--------------
It's not finished yet. If you want use it do it on your own.
The work is very old, I writed it time ago. I stopped the project,
because I noticed the app works on some servers, and on some not. 
This is caused by the server configuration which have defined 
the amount of bytes when the output buffer data is sent to the browser.
Of course the app still requires some work.

Description
--------------
This app is built under PHP and also uses bootstrap framework. It requires at least PHP 5.2
The main purpose of the app is downloading big and small files in realtime with small help of the AJAX.
It uses the server bandwidth(everything is done by server side).

Why you should use it?

Answer is easy, is fast and user friendly!
